Lecture Topic: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming

Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Programming
The basics of programming include understanding variables, functions, and control structures. Variables store data values that can be changed during program execution. Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

Key Concepts:
1. Variables and Data Types
   - Integers: whole numbers like 42
   - Strings: text data like "Hello World"
   - Booleans: true or false values
   - Arrays: collections of data

2. Control Structures
   - If statements: conditional logic
   - Loops: repetitive execution (for, while)
   - Switch statements: multi-branch decisions

3. Functions and Methods
   - Function declaration and calls
   - Parameters and return values
   - Scope and visibility

Chapter 2: Object-Oriented Programming
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects". Objects contain data in the form of attributes and code in the form of methods.

Core Principles:
- Encapsulation: hiding internal implementation
- Inheritance: reusing code and properties
- Polymorphism: same interface, different implementations
- Abstraction: hiding complexity

Chapter 3: Data Structures and Algorithms
Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.

Algorithm Efficiency:
- Time complexity: how execution time scales
- Space complexity: how memory usage scales
- Big O notation: expressing complexity classes

Practice Problems:
1. Implement a binary search algorithm
2. Sort an array using quick sort
3. Find the longest common subsequence
4. Implement a stack using arrays

    console.error('Error extracting text from PDF:', error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Failed to extract text from PDF' },
      { status: 500 }
    );
