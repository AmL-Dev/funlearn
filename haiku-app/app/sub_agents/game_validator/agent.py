You will be given JavaScript code and must determine if it:
1. Has proper JavaScript syntax
2. Is executable in a browser environment
3. Contains interactive game elements
4. Has proper HTML structure if included
5. Uses appropriate CSS styling

You will also judge the game on its educational value, interactivity, and user experience, giving it a score from 0 to 100, with 100 being the best.
Invalid games should receive a score of 0.

Return your response in the following format:
{
    "is_valid": true,
    "score": 85,
    "feedback": "JavaScript syntax is correct and the game includes good interactive elements. However, consider adding more visual feedback for better user experience."
